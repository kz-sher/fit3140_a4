Libraries that you need to install:

step 1 - open three terminals
step 2 - cd to all server[1 | 2 | 3] of either the directory “JSON” or “ProtocolBuffer”
step 3 - node server.js respectively
step 4 - log on to ‘http://localhost:’ + portNo [3000 | 3001 | 3002]
step 5 - play them yourself as clients C1, C2 and C3
